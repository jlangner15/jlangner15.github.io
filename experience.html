                Researched all main serial communication protocols(SPI, UART, I2C) to collaborate on a testing module for a Raspberry Pi 3(RPi 3) last year.
                The goal of this project is to test functionality of Vehicle Control Unit related hardware easily and more efficiently with a RPi3 instead of using the VCU modules implemented on the car already.
                I specifically developed the module that utilized SPI communication. This project followed a rigorous software design process that included:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design specification</li>
                <li>Software Engineering principals</li>
                <li>Design strategy and implementation</li>
                <li>Code review and testing</li>
                <li>Documentation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In the last ccouple months our sub team has been researching and developing a telemetry module to transfer significant data
                stats live with the car to the bay at SAE competitions. This process started by collectively researching and learning how
                our radio modules operate. Now we are developing the module to actually extract data from the VCU to send between radios.
                I recently refactored our UART module to increase its generality and usability while adding layers of abstraction in
                preparation for different hardware specifications associated with the module.

        <p><b>McMaster Engineering Competition 2020</b></p>
        <p>The McMaster Engineering Competition(MEC) 2020 was run as a 2 day virtual event for all undergraduate engineering students who wanted to participate.
            This years competition was significantly different since it was entirely virtual. The goal was for each member to create
            a Rudy Goldberg machine, film it performing a simple task in an entertaining yet effective manor. These videos were first
            combined in a slideshow and shown to the judges. Five groups, including us, moved on to the next stage where we had to pitch our ideas.
            Our pitch involved presenting to the panel of judges with while presenting the informal ideas of the machine in a technical and formal format.
            Although this experience was different than the previous year it was a great opportunity to practice and present over virtual
            meetings and collaborate with members virtually as well.</p>

        <p><b>McMaster Engineering Competition 2019</b></p>
        <p> The MEC in 2019 was a more traditional style since it was an in person single day event. The task was to create a freestanding structure to
            withstand a certain amount of wind from a single source. Our group of four was given several specifications and constraints regarding our solution.
            The two biggest constraints were time and cost. We had to plan, build and prototype a our structure using materials that we had to "purchase" from
            the committee using the given budget. We also had deadlines on presenting, demonstrating and submitting all work involved. Overall this was a great experience to
            improve collaborating and problem solving skills since it was with an unfamiliar group with a small scale problem but realistic constraints and expectations.
