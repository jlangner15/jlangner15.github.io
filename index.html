                    Researched all main serial communication protocols(SPI, UART, I2C) to collaborate on a testing module for a Raspberry Pi 3(RPi 3) last year.
                    The goal of this project is to test functionality of Vehicle Control Unit related hardware easily and more efficiently with a RPi3 instead of using the VCU modules implemented on the car already.
                    I specifically developed the module that utilized SPI communication. This project followed a rigorous software design process that included:
                    <ul class="mt-1 mb- pl-4">
                        <li>Design specification</li>
                        <li>Software Engineering principals</li>
                        <li>Design strategy and implementation</li>
                        <li>Code review and testing</li>
                        <li>Documentation</li>
                    </ul>
                    In the last ccouple months our sub team has been researching and developing a telemetry module to transfer significant data
                    stats live with the car to the bay at SAE competitions. This process started by collectively researching and learning how
                    our radio modules operate. Now we are developing the module to actually extract data from the VCU to send between radios.
                    I recently refactored our UART module to increase its generality and usability while adding layers of abstraction in
                    preparation for different hardware specifications associated with the module.

                <small>McMaster Engineering Competition 2020</small>
                <p>The McMaster Engineering Competition(MEC) 2020 was run as a 2 day virtual event for all undergraduate engineering students who wanted to participate.
                    This years competition was significantly different since it was entirely virtual. The goal was for each member to create
                    a Rudy Goldberg machine, film it performing a simple task in an entertaining yet effective manor. These videos were first
                    combined in a slideshow and shown to the judges. Five groups, including us, moved on to the next stage where we had to pitch our ideas.
                    Our pitch involved presenting to the panel of judges with while presenting the informal ideas of the machine in a technical and formal format.
                    Although this experience was different than the previous year it was a great opportunity to practice and present over virtual
                    meetings and collaborate with members virtually as well.</p>

                <small>McMaster Engineering Competition 2019</small>
                <p> The MEC in 2019 was a more traditional style since it was an in person single day event. The task was to create a freestanding structure to
                    withstand a certain amount of wind from a single source. Our group of four was given several specifications and constraints regarding our solution.
                    The two biggest constraints were time and cost. We had to plan, build and prototype a our structure using materials that we had to "purchase" from
                    the committee using the given budget. We also had deadlines on presenting, demonstrating and submitting all work involved. Overall this was a great experience to
                    improve collaborating and problem solving skills since it was with an unfamiliar group with a small scale problem but realistic constraints and expectations.

                                Researched all main serial communication protocols(SPI, UART, I2C) to collaborate on a testing module for a Raspberry Pi 3(RPi3) using Python.

                                I took an object oriented approach in Python to add a layer of abstraction and encapsulate all individual functions under a single class.
                                This implementation used a library known as spidev to handle communication between the RPi3 and the accelerometer.

                                I cam across two fellow post secondary students, a recent high school graduate looking applying for college in the U.S from Bangladesh
                                and a Sophmore Electrical Engineering student studying at Netaji Subhash University Of Technology in India.
                                The three of use wanted to learn a new framework or language so we decided to learn Flask, a common beginner web application framework using Python.
                                The theme of the hack was to reinvent, take a different approach to old code. One of the members had some old c++ code to check for balanced parenthesis
                                within an input or a file. This is an important problem in computing, often used in compilers to check properly nested functions and methods.
                                We translated this code to Python and decided the user should be able to input a string of their choice or upload a file to check.
                                I specifically worked on the backend of the application, ensuring the user can input data and upload files properly, run the scripts and output the result.
                                I also had to interlace the front end with the backend and aided in the algorithm design process. Ultimately we created a functioning web application, a first for all of us
                                that solves an intermediate yet important problem.
