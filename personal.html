    <h3>Personal</h3>
    <p>Here is my personal hobby music page.
        Thanks to my roomates, I started playing bass in the fall of 2020 as they wanted a bass player to jam with them.
        I picked up a used starter bass package on kijiji, a yorkville y50b amp and a '93 yamaha rbx p/j bass. I fell in love instantly and picked it up quickly with daily practice.
        I played piano throughout my childhood and into high school and also played trumpet in the high school band, however I enjoy the bass far more.
