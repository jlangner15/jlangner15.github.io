                            Researched all main serial communication protocols(SPI, UART, I2C) to collaborate on a testing module for a Raspberry Pi 3(RPi3) using Python.
                            The goal of this project is to test functionality of Vehicle Control Unit related hardware easily and more efficiently with a RPi3
                            instead of using the VCU modules implemented on the car already. This specific project was to test functionality of an accelerometer.
                            I took an object oriented approach in Python to add a layer of abstraction and encapsulate all individual functions under a single class.
                            This implementation used a library known as spidev to handle communication between the RPi3 and the accelerometer.

                            Entered my first hackathon; Back to Hacking 2021 which was a virtual hackathon help from November 19 - 21, 2021.first time hackers.
                            I cam across two fellow post secondary students, a recent high school graduate looking applying for college in the U.S from Bangladesh
                            and a Sophmore Electrical Engineering student studying at Netaji Subhash University Of Technology in India.
                            The three of use wanted to learn a new framework or language so we decided to learn Flask, a common beginner web application framework using Python.
                            The theme of the hack was to reinvent, take a different approach to old code. One of the members had some old c++ code to check for balanced parenthesis
                            within an input or a file. This is an important problem in computing, often used in compilers to check properly nested functions and methods.
                            We translated this code to Python and decided the user should be able to input a string of their choice or upload a file to check.
                            I specifically worked on the backend of the application, ensuring the user can input data and upload files properly, run the scripts and output the result.
                            I also had to interlace the front end with the backend and aided in the algorithm design process. Ultimately we created a functioning web application, a first for all of us
                            that solves an intermediate yet important problem.
